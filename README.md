# LazyPocketBook PC
LazyPocketBook is an app that allows you to change pages remotely on your PocketBook e-reader.

# INSTALLING GUIDE
To use LazyPocketBook you must install Python and some Python modules.
Make sure you have Python3 installed.
Install paramiko, pyxhook and plyer modules.
`pip3 install paramiko`
`pip3 install pyxhook`
`pip3 install plyer`


# TO DO 
1. Checking if ssh is active, if not exit()
2. ~~Key combination (for exampla ctrl+arrow_up, to go forward etc.)~~
3. Make it more user friendly
4. ~~Create version for Windows (pyxhook works only on linux, pyhook works on Windows)~~, 'keyboard' module works on both but there is a need for sudo/admin, and I have some import problems with that module.
