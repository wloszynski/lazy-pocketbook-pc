# lazy-pocketbook-pc
remote page changer for PocketBook e-reader.

# IN PROGRESS

# TO DO 
1. Checking if ssh is active, if not exit()
2. Key combination (for exampla ctrl+arrow_up, to go forward etc.)
3. Make it more user friendly
4. Create version for Windows (pyxhook works only on linux, pyhook works on Windows), 'keyboard' module works on both but there is a need for sudo/admin, and I have some import problems with that module.
